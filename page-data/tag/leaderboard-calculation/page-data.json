Implementing a leaderboard could be easy but, when the number of users raised to several dozens of thousands, a lot of response time problems start to appear. And, in our case, we had to show the playerâ€™s current ranking along with the leaderboard in real-time after each round and the delay between the 2 rounds was of 20 seconds. So, we really wanted it to be too fast say in a couple of seconds and it should work for at least 1 million active users.
