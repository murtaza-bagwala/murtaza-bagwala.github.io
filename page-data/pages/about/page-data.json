I have worked predominantly with the JVM and Javascript ecosystem but currently working on Golang. For me, software engineering is all about solving problems in the most optimal way. I am an avid practitioner of clean code practices and love to read about System Design and Architectures. When I am not coding I love to explore AI tools, writing blogs, I love to play playstation, read anything about aviation or go out for a long drive and of-course I am foodie by heart.</p>\n<p>I’m naturally curious, always asking questions, whether it’s a teammate or even the CEO. I believe in full transparency at work: no office politics, no hidden agendas. Concerns should be raised directly, and communication should be clear, honest, and to the point. I’m a big fan of the “no hellos, just messages” approach in chats.</p>\n<p>I value processes, but only as much as they help productivity, not as rigid rules that slow us down. My goal is simple: get things built. Clients and colleagues trust me to deliver, and I work best in environments where that trust is mutual. I don’t need micromanagement, and I don’t micromanage others.</p>\n<p>I’m not a “resource.” I’m an engineer, and I thrive in employee-driven environments where trust, freedom, and respect come first. I don’t care about fancy perks or superficial gestures. I care about being trusted and having the space to do my best work. That’s how I work, and that’s how I thrive.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2246977889","2727970573","984292147"],"slicesMap":{}}
