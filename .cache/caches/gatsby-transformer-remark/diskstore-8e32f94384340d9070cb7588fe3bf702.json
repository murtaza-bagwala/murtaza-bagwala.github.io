So, we can have a Bucket with attributes (range and counter) stored in Redis. Now, we can divide the scores into buckets (Bucket 1 = 0-100), (Bucket 2 = 100-200), (Bucket 3 = 200-300), (Bucket 4 = 300-400) and each time we add the score for a player we will find out the bucket based on the score, we will increment the bucket’s counter and will save the reference of the selected Bucket in the player’s record. And when we need to calculate the player’s rank we’ll fetch the bucket referenced in a player record we’ll find out the number of players who have more scores than the current player in the current Bucket along with the value of counters of the buckets that precedes current bucket.  For example(for playerId: 9 the bucket stored in it is 2 and its current score is 130. Now, in order to calculate its rank we need to calculate the number of users who have scores >= 130 + the value of the counter of bucket 3 + the value of the counter of bucket 4  ). Again in this approach, we need to pre-create the buckets and decide their range. Also, the last query to calculate the number of players who have more scores than the current player in a bucket can be slow if our buckets are so big and we have a lot of users in each bucket.","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":2166},"end":{"line":18,"column":1442,"offset":3607},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":2166},"end":{"line":18,"column":1442,"offset":3607},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"image","title":null,"url":"/bucket.jpg","alt":"alt","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1,"offset":3609},"end":{"line":20,"column":20,"offset":3628},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1,"offset":3609},"end":{"line":20,"column":20,"offset":3628},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"children":[{"type":"link","url":"#self-balanced-binary-search-tree-sbbst","title":null,"children":[],"data":{"hProperties":{"aria-label":"self balanced binary search tree sbbst permalink","class":"anchor before"},"hChildren":[{"type":"raw","value":"<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg>"}]}},{"type":"text","value":"Self Balanced Binary Search Tree (SBBST)","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":3,"offset":3632},"end":{"line":22,"column":43,"offset":3672},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1,"offset":3630},"end":{"line":22,"column":43,"offset":3672},"indent":[]},"data":{"id":"self-balanced-binary-search-tree-sbbst","htmlAttributes":{"id":"self-balanced-binary-search-tree-sbbst"},"hProperties":{"id":"self-balanced-binary-search-tree-sbbst","style":"position:relative;"}}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"An SBBST is a particular kind of binary search tree, it means each node is linked at most to two subtrees, commonly denoted left and right.
