I really tried hard to understand it but, didn't get succeed. I started asking people and it came like Monad seems to have a very bad reputation in many communities. I heard many times people saying that they are “too complicated” even if they really aren’t inspite of the fact that Monads are one of the most useful and powerful tools we have in functional programming."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/verbs-who-rule-the-city-of-nouns","categorySlug":"/category/functional-programming/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Verbs who rule the City of Nouns","date":"2017-04-03T22:40:32.169Z","category":"Functional Programming","description":"Now the time has changed.
